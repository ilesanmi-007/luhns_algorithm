# Luhn's Algorithm

## Overview
This repository contains an implementation of Luhn's Algorithm, a simple checksum formula used to validate credit card numbers. 
The implementation includes functions for calculating the validity of a card number and outputting the result.

## Features
- **Card Number Validation**: Checks whether a given card number is valid according to the Luhn algorithm.
- **User-Friendly Output**: Returns a message indicating whether the card is valid or invalid.
- **Modular Design**: The code is organized into functions for easy testing and reuse.

## Getting Started
